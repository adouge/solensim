solensim v0.2.0-alpha.2

To use, please run solensim.py in an iPython environment of choice;
only an iPython interface is so far implemented.
WIP help text will display upon script loading.

m_script.m is the MATLAB code; the Python-MATLAB interface is in place, but we haven't
yet figured out a way to introduce it well into the python program.
