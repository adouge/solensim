0.3.2, WIP:
  - ASTRA plugin:
    - wrote a helptext documenting the ASTRA plugin
    - changing track preset no longer tries to load the corresponding beam
    - changed interface formatting a bit
    - added ability to write beam.ini from beam dataframe
    - added verbosity control to frontend
    - is pretty much done for now, aside from, eventually, loading other output files
  - Tracking presets:
    - added cross, square box beams
    - added skewed and symmetrical gaussian rings beams
    - turned off field scaling in default runfile
  - General:
    - main script is "production-ready", for what it can do now;
    - changelog should be more structured
    - changed sscode package to solensim; having a solensim folder inside a solensim folder is not too bad, but looks better in the code.
    - expanded the readme.txt
  - TBA

0.3.1, 11.09.20:
  - implemented preset management in ASTRA plugin
  - finished default ASTRA plugin setups

0.3.0, 10.09.20:
  - start a changelog
  - add concept flowchart to docs
  - fix get_astra to add executable flag to the downloaded binaries
  - restructuring again, this time final - placeholder classes everywhere
  - closed #29 (wontfix, getting over my head with all the pointless "cool developer" shenanigans)
  - remove old code (I still have it, just to declutter)
  - added a placeholder .ini file for the future
  - Worked up an ASTRA plugin/interface, see associated v0.3 issues
  - Reogranized the docs a bit
  - Realized the grave need for documentation.

0.2.1, 25.08.20:
  - restructure code for future feature expansion
  - lay "structure" for MATLAB, Astra plugins
  - update build script to accomodate new changes
  - remove circular dependency of wrapper/frontend (FE calls method of W which calls methods added in FE)

0.2.0, Foundation: start of change logging
