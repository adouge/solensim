0.3.0, 01.09.20:
  - start a changelog
  - add concept flowchart to docs
  - fix get_astra to add executable flag to the downloaded binaries
  - restructuring again, this time final
  - closed #29 (wontfix, getting over my head with all the pointless "cool developer" shenanigans)
  
0.2.1, 25.08.20:
  - restructure code for future feature expansion
  - lay "structure" for MATLAB, Astra plugins
  - update build script to accomodate new changes
  - remove circular dependency of wrapper/frontend (FE calls method of W which calls methods added in FE)
